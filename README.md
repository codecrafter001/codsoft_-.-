# codsoft_-.-

Hey there! Welcome to my **codsoft_-.-** repository. This is where I’ve put together some of the projects I worked on during my internship at CodSoft. These are pretty simple but useful tools that I built to sharpen my coding skills.

### What’s Inside

1. To-Do List
A basic to-do list app that helps you keep track of your tasks. You can:

- Add Tasks: Just add whatever you need to get done.
- Mark as Done: Tick off tasks once they’re complete.
- Delete Tasks: Get rid of tasks you don’t need anymore.
- Save/Load: Save your list and load it up later when you need it.

2. Simple Calculator
A straightforward calculator made with Tkinter. It does all the usual stuff:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication(*)
- Division(/)
- Clear and Reset to start fresh

3. Password Generator
Need a strong password? This tool’s got you covered. It lets you:

- Choose Length: Set how long you want your password to be.
- Character Options: Pick if you want to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Copy to Clipboard: Quickly copy the generated password.

## How to Get Started

1. Clone this repo:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codsoft_-.-.git
    ```
2. Go to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd codsoft_-.- 
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the projects:
    - For the To-Do List: `python todo_list.py`
    - For the Simple Calculator: `python calculator.py`
    - For the Password Generator: `python password_generator.py`

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Everything here is coded in Python.
- **Tkinter**: Used to create the GUI for the apps.
- **PyQt5**: (If I used it) Added for some advanced GUI features.
